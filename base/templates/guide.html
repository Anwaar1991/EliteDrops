                                <h1>Ultimate Guide to Product Research for Dropshipping</h1>
                                
                                <p>Are you struggling to find profitable products to sell in your dropshipping store? How many hours have you wasted scrounging through 'Winning Product' lists only for none of them to work? How much money have you needlessly lost on testing dozens of products you didn’t know anything about? All to get that first sale, think you finally found something... Only for those coveted next few sales you think will change it all to either never come, or the cost per purchase makes selling it a loss.</p>
                                
                                <p>That changes here and now.</p>

                                <p>No hopping on bandwagons hoping for a quick buck, and no subjective 'feelings' about what you think will sell. Product research is a PROCESS. A process guided by DATA with the primary limitation being your ability to execute on your findings.</p>

                                <p>Let us first get down to the basics before I give you the full step-by-step process.</p>
                                
                                <h2>In Commerce, There Are Only Two Options:</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You create demand</li>
                                    <li>You fulfill demand</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>In dropshipping, we DO NOT create demand. We are not selling unique products; we are selling products that are already being sold elsewhere by others. Ergo, we are ONLY fulfilling demand.</p>
                                
                                <p>Therefore, we must be better at fulfilling the demand of a product than our competitors.</p>
                                
                                <p>So long as you follow that logic all the way through, you will never, ever choose a product you can't sell again.</p>
                                
                                <p>So here is our very simple multi-step process:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Find demand not being met</li>
                                    <li>Investigate competition for weaknesses</li>
                                    <li>Note your strengths</li>
                                    <li>Develop plan of attack</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>For simplicity, we'll call this the FIND process.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Let's Dig Deeper Into Each of These Steps</h2>

                                <h3>STEP 1: FIND DEMAND NOT BEING MET</h3>
                                
                                <p>So the big question is, how do we find demand?</p>
                                
                                <p>The simple answer is we utilize SEO research techniques.</p>
                                
                                <p>Why?</p>
                                
                                <p>Simple, because SEO is all about finding what people are already looking for and how to give them the content they want. This is exactly what we’re trying to do, except instead of blog posts we’re directing them to the products they’re looking for.</p>
                                
                                <p>I use Semrush since it's an all-in-one, but you can use whatever SEO tool you want. So long as it covers all the basics of showing you:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Keyword Difficulty</li>
                                    <li>Search Volume</li>
                                    <li>Cost Per Click</li>
                                    <li>Keyword Intent</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Go into whichever keyword research tool you prefer and set your search parameters as such:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Keyword Difficulty: 0-30%</li>
                                    <li>Keyword Intent: Transactional</li>
                                    <li>Sort Search Volume by descending order</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Now the fun part! We are going to look for products. There are a few basic ways of doing this:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>You look at products on Aliexpress and when you find one that interests you throw its name into the keyword research tool to see what it spits out.</li>
                                    <li>Use adjectives to find the exact descriptor/variant of a product someone wants.</li>
                                    <li>Use generic nouns to find related products concerning that broad keyword.</li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <p>Regardless of how you do it, you should find multiple products that look appealing. However, not all products are created equal, so find a sampling of at least 10 products. You are going to put every keyword into a spreadsheet with a column for its Difficulty rating, Search Volume, Cost Per Click, and a final column labeled “Opportunity Score”.</p>
                                
                                <p>At the end, your spreadsheet should look like this.</p>
                                
                                <span style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 30px 10px;"><img src="{% static 'image/product.PNG' %}" alt="Table Image" style="width: 380px; border: 1px solid black;"></span>
                                <p>The Opportunity Score of a keyword/product is a custom formula we’re going to make. Let us briefly go over what the Opportunity Score is and isn’t.</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A given keyword’s opportunity score IS NOT absolute.</li>
                                    <li>A given keyword’s opportunity score IS relative to the score of other keywords it's compared to.</li>
                                    <li>The higher the opportunity score, the more likely it is to be profitable.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>The formula we use to determine our opportunity score is as follows:</p>
                                
                                <p><code>OPPORTUNITY SCORE = SEARCH VOLUME x (1 / KEYWORD DIFFICULTY RATING) x (1 + COST PER CLICK)</code></p>
                                
                                <p>As you can ascertain from this formula, the basic idea is the lower the Keyword Difficulty we can safely presume the easier it will be for you to attain search volume. This is then further modified by a higher cost per click favorably increasing opportunity. As it is a very safe bet that the more money marketers are putting into this keyword the more desirable it is.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thus, the product with the lowest difficulty, highest search volume, and most competitive interest from marketers is the natural winner.</p>
                                
                                <p>Now you should have a spreadsheet that looks something like this:</p>
                                <span style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 30px 10px;"><img src="{% static 'image/product1.PNG' %}" alt="Table Image" style="width: 380px; border: 1px solid black;"></span>
                                
                                <p>As you may also notice, this formula will also show the potential of lower search volume keywords. Note that in our example, Product 7 has a higher opportunity score than Product 8 despite having almost 1/3rd the search volume. This is almost entirely due to the high CPC associated with it, indicating that this product has high marketing interest despite the low competition for the keyword.</p>
                                
                                <p>The opportunity score formula is not perfect. It is simply what I have found to be the most reliable. If anyone else has anything different/better, then they are free to share.</p>
                                
                                <p>Regardless, the opportunity score does NOT reveal the full picture and tell you what product to sell. It simply gives us a list of products to investigate in order until we find our winner.</p>
                                
                                <h3>STEP 2: INVESTIGATE COMPETITION FOR WEAKNESSES</h3>
                                
                                <p>Just because you found what, on its face, looks like a great opportunity does not mean it is perfect.</p>
                                
                                <p>Starting with the product that has the highest Opportunity Score, we will now screen each one against your would-be competitors to investigate the competitive landscape.</p>
                                
                                <p>In your SEO tool, or another if it’s not an all-in-one, we will look at the Search Engine Ranking Positions (SERPs) for your specific keyword.</p>
                                
                                <p>There are many factors to take notice of. Let us start with the most obvious ones to take note of in your research notes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>How many of the top 10 SERPs are sellers?</li>
                                    <li>How many of the sellers are general websites like Walmart, Amazon, Target, etc.?</li>
                                    <li>How many of the sellers are small brands?</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Many will say that if your product is sold in a general website like Amazon, Walmart, and others, then your product is dead in the water.</p>
                                
                                <p>Contrary to popular belief, that is simply false.</p>
                                
                                <p>Why?</p>
                                
                                <p>Two reasons:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A general store may meet the desired demand, but it may not even be advertising the availability of a product there.</li>
                                    <li>People want to buy from the source. They feel it’s more trustworthy and authentic.</li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <p>Prime example: you can buy Apple products from general stores, but it’s well known that Apple makes the majority of its revenue from people buying directly from its website, or in-person stores.</p>
                                
                                <p>As long as you’re not competing against the original brand of the product, being sold on general stores actually helps validate the demand for a product, but it does make marketing harder. So long as your own store is highly professional looking and works without a hitch, you have good odds at undercutting them by having more competitive pricing.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Competitive Analysis in Detail</h3>
                                
                                <p>Next, let us look at the smaller competitors:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Do they have professional-looking websites?</li>
                                    <li>Are they advertising their products?</li>
                                    <li>What is their pricing model like?</li>
                                    <li>Do they have positive reviews?</li>
                                    <li>Are there complaints in reviews regarding quality, customer service, or delivery times?</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Taking notes on these aspects can help you identify weaknesses that you can exploit in your own store. For instance:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If competitors have unprofessional websites, ensure your website looks polished and trustworthy.</li>
                                    <li>If they are not advertising, you have a chance to capture the market through targeted ads.</li>
                                    <li>If reviews mention poor customer service or long delivery times, emphasize your superior service and faster delivery.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>By understanding the competitive landscape thoroughly, you can better position your store to attract customers who are dissatisfied with existing options.</p>
                                
                                <h3>STEP 3: NOTE YOUR STRENGTHS</h3>
                                
                                <p>Knowing your competition's weaknesses is important, but equally important is knowing your own strengths.</p>
                                
                                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>What can you do better than your competition?</li>
                                    <li>What unique value propositions can you offer?</li>
                                    <li>Can you provide better customer service, faster shipping, or a better product presentation?</li>
                                    <li>Do you have better sourcing connections that allow you to offer competitive pricing?</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>Identifying your strengths and playing to them will help you stand out in a crowded market.</p>
                                
                                <h3>STEP 4: DEVELOP PLAN OF ATTACK</h3>
                                
                                <p>Once you have identified a product with demand and have a clear understanding of your competition and your own strengths, it's time to develop your plan of attack.</p>
                                
                                <p>This involves:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Creating a professional and user-friendly website</li>
                                    <li>Developing a competitive pricing strategy</li>
                                    <li>Creating compelling product listings with high-quality images and detailed descriptions</li>
                                    <li>Planning your marketing strategy, including SEO, social media, and paid advertising</li>
                                    <li>Ensuring excellent customer service and efficient order fulfillment</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>With a clear plan in place, you will be well-equipped to launch your product and start fulfilling the demand you've identified.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                
                                <p>Product research is the cornerstone of a successful dropshipping venture. By systematically identifying unmet demand, analyzing competition, and leveraging your strengths, you can significantly increase your chances of finding profitable products.
                                </p>

Remember, the FIND process is a tool to guide your research, not a guaranteed formula for success. Continuously adapt and refine your approach based on market trends and your specific business goals.
